# Artificial Intelligence Topics Project (ColÃ©gio TÃ©cnico de Campinas - COTUCA): Traveling Salesperson Problem with Pick-up and Delivery (TSPPD)

This project was developed during the Artificial Intelligence Topics classes at the Campinas Technical College - COTUCA, taught by professor Guilherme de Oliveira Macedo. Its objective is to explore the application of two metaheuristics, **Simulated Annealing (SA)** and **Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA)**, to solve the Traveling Salesperson Problem with Pick-up and Delivery (TSPPD). The goal is to determine the most efficient route, ensuring that each item is collected before its respective delivery and that each location is visited only once.

## ðŸ’» Technologies and Algorithms

Two distinct metaheuristics were implemented and compared to solve the TSPPD:

### 1. Simulated Annealing (SA)

Inspired by the process of metal annealing, SA explores the solution space by probabilistically accepting movements to higher-cost states to avoid local optima.

* **How it Works:** It starts with an initial solution and a high temperature. In each iteration, a neighboring solution is generated. If the neighboring solution is better, it is accepted. If it is worse, it can be accepted with a certain probability that decreases over time (as the temperature reduces). The process ends when the temperature reaches a predefined minimum value.

### 2. Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA)

Based on principles of natural evolution, BRKGA uses vectors of random keys (chromosomes) to represent solutions. The problem's intelligence is encapsulated in a `Decoder` that transforms these vectors into valid routes.

* **How it Works:**
    1.  **Population Initialization:** An initial population of random chromosomes is generated.
    2.  **Evaluation and Decoding:** Each chromosome is passed to the `Decoder`, which maps the random keys to a point permutation. It then applies a repair function (`_fix_solution`) to ensure all precedence constraints (pickup before delivery) are met. The total route cost is calculated, serving as the chromosome's fitness.
    3.  **Evolution:** The population evolves through:
        * **Selection:** The best individuals form the elite group, while the rest are non-elite.
        * **Recombination:** New offspring are generated by combining genes from an elite parent and a non-elite parent.
        * **Mutation:** A small portion of the new population consists of mutantsâ€”completely randomly generated chromosomesâ€”to inject diversity and prevent premature convergence.
    4.  **Conclusion:** The evolutionary cycle repeats for a predefined number of generations, and the best chromosome found is kept and its decoded solution represents the final result.

## ðŸ“Š Results Analysis

The comparative performance analysis of the algorithms was conducted using the **Percent Deviation (GAP)**, which measures the quality of a solution relative to the Best Known Solution (BKS). A smaller GAP indicates a solution closer to the optimal reference.

* **BRKGA** consistently outperformed **SA** in terms of solution quality, showing a significantly smaller percent deviation (GAP) compared to the BKS across all evaluated instances. This demonstrates its greater effectiveness in exploring the search landscape and handling the problem's complex constraints, finding routes with substantially lower costs.
* **SA**, on the other hand, showed a considerable advantage in **execution time**, being orders of magnitude faster than BRKGA. However, this speed came at the cost of lower-quality solutions, with much higher percent GAPs compared to the BKS.

**Conclusion:** The choice between the two approaches depends directly on the problem's objective. If the focus is on obtaining solutions quickly with acceptable precision, SA may be sufficient. However, for applications that demand high-quality solutions, even with a higher computational cost, BRKGA is clearly the more suitable choice.
